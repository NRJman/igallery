# IGallery

This is my brand new Instagram clone project which is in a development process. However, it doesn't mean that you need to hesitate to check out my code :)

## What have been practiced?

Already have got started with RxJS and the latest version of NgRx.

## Running

Clone this repo, move to the project directory, run "npm install" and "ng serve -o" after that. 

## License

There is no any license for it. You can use any data from this repo if you want so :)
